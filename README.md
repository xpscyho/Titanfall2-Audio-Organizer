# Titanfall2-Audio-Organizer
very work in progress organizer and converter script
# Installation
The only prerequisite other than windows i can think of is ffmpeg
i think you can pip install ffmpeg but im not sure 
any way that gets it into path works i guess


# TO DO

- [ ] Redo the organization system lmao
- [ ] make a mover operation so there wont be tons of duplicates once the .bat is done
- [ ] add more groups, like grunt dialogue and sound effects

# How to get the audio files from Titanfall 2

You need a dedicated tool like Legion from DTZxPorter
you can get it here https://wiki.modme.co/wiki/apps/Legion.html
MAKE SURE YOU GET THE V.13 VERSION because 2.24 was made for apex and is incompatible with tf2 ðŸ˜”

you can find the audio mbnk here

\Titanfall2\r2\sound\general.mbnk

open this with Legion and extract it

it will be in uncompressed .wav format so make sure you have 80GB of storage ready
my tool can compress the files with ffmpeg, it takes around 30 minutes to an hour on my hardware 
the compressed files come up to around 8 GB

after it compresses the files, my thing will probably keep copying for the organization (WHICH IS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO DONE BTW) im adding it to github for some reason even though its not close to ready to share with other people lmoa

# Suggestions
please suggest stuff in an issue

i have no creative juice to think of ideas other than what i added in the todo
